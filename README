## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the effect of injuries on the win probability of NFL teams. By scraping injury data and considering various team and player characteristics, we can derive insights into how injuries influence the outcome of games.

## Data Collection
To gather the necessary data, I utilized pro football reference data and a dedicated scraper repository. This allowed me to collect player data and aggregate it at the team level, providing a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

## Analysis
Using logistic regression, I conducted a thorough analysis to determine the impact of injuries on win probability. The results revealed a moderate influence of injuries on the likelihood of winning games.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project sheds light on the significant role injuries play in determining the outcome of NFL games. By understanding the relationship between injuries and win probability, teams can make informed decisions to optimize their performance on the field.
