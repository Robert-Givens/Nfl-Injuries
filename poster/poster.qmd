# Abstract
<div class="space-20"></div>
This study examines the impact of player injuries on NFL team win probabilities over the seasons 2013 to 2019. The research dissects the data by the number of injuries, overall team influence, and the effect at each position. The findings suggest that injuries have a variable impact on win probabilities, with certain positions showing a more pronounced effect.
