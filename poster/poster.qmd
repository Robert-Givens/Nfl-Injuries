# Abstract
<div class="space-20"></div>
This study examines the impact of player injuries on NFL team win probabilities over the seasons 2013 to 2019. The research dissects the data by the number of injuries, overall team influence, and the effect at each position. The findings suggest that injuries have a variable impact on win probabilities, with certain positions showing a more pronounced effect.

# Exploring Team Level Data

- **Worst Performers**: Cleveland, Jacksonville, Tampa Bay, and Washington, New York (G) were the lowest performing teams
- **QB Injuries**: Cincinnati, Minnesota, Cleveland, Carolina, and Pittsburgh had the most injuries at QB
- **Worst Ranked**: Top five in losses also show high ranks in injuries occurance across most significant positions.

# Model

:::{.block fill="luma(230)" inset="8pt" radius="4pt"}

To investigate the impact of injuries on team performance, we employed a logistic regression model. This model allowed us to control for team-specific effects and incorporate dummy variables for each position, indicating whether an injury was present.

<div class="space-20"></div>

The logistic regression equation can be represented as follows:

<div class="space-20"></div>

$$
\log\left(\frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_nX_n
$$

<div class="space-20"></div>

Where:
- $P(Y=1)$ is the probability of a team winning given the set of predictors.
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept.
- $\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n$ are the coefficients for each predictor $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$, including team effects and injury status for each position.

<div class="space-20"></div>

This model allows us to quantify the impact of injuries across different positions on the likelihood of a team's win, adjusting for inherent team strengths and weaknesses.

## Key Findings on Position Impact

- **Significant Impact**: QBs, RBs, WRs, and Kickers correlate strongly with win probabilities.
- **Positive Surprises**: TEs and LBs show unexpected positive effects on wins.
- **Insight**: Positions traditionally seen in support roles may have underrated contributions to team success.

*All findings are statistically significant, highlighting areas for strategic team development.*

# Conclusion

Our findings highlight the nuanced impact of player injuries on NFL teams' performance. The logistic regression model revealed that certain positions are more critical to a team's win probability. This analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of strategic team management and injury prevention in professional sports.
